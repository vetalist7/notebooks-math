As you work with probabilities, though, you will more likely see it expressed as a decimal (in this case .70), which must be between 0.0 and 1.0:\n","P(X) =.70\n","Sometimes people use the terms probability and statistics interchangeably, and while it is understandable to conflate the two disciplines, they do have distinctions. Proba‐ bility is purely theoretical of how likely an event is to happen and does not require data. Statistics, on the other hand, cannot exist without data and uses it to discover probability and provides tools to describe data.\n","\n","# Joint probability\n","Let’s say you have a fair coin and a fair six-sided die. You want to find the probability of flipping a heads and rolling a 6 on the coin and die, respectively. These are two separate probabilities of two separate events, but we want to find the probability that both events will occur together. This is known as a joint probability:\n","P(A AND B) = P(A) × P(B)\n","\n","# Union Probabilities\n","When we deal with OR operations with probabilities, this is known as a union probability.\n","Let’s start with mutually exclusive events, which are events that cannot occur simulta‐ neously. For example, if I roll one die I cannot simultaneously get a 4 and a 6. I can only get one outcome. Getting the union probability for these cases is easy. I simply add them together. If I want to find the probability of getting a 4 or 6 on a die roll, it is going to be 2/6 = 1/3:\n","P(4) = 1/6\n","P(6) = 1/6\n","P(4 OR 6) =1/6+1/6=1/3\n","\n","# Sum rule of probability\n","Sum rule of probability ensures every joint event is counted only once:\n","P(A OR B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A AND B)\n","P(A OR B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A) * P(B)\n","\n","# Conditional probability\n","A probability topic that easily confuses people is the concept of conditional probabil‐ ity, which is the probability of an event A occurring given event B has occurred. It is typically expressed as P(A GIVEN B) or P(A|B).\n","\n","# Bayes' Theorem\n","P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B).\n","Using Bayes’ Theorem in Python:"],"metadata":{"id":"okh6GekVJwM9"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"53bHP6HqJrTV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687287939283,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Vitalii Bakumenko","userId":"13958704867610304595"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["p_coffee_drinker = .65\n","p_cancer = 0.005\n","p_coffee_drinker_given_cancer = 0.85"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["p_cancer_given_coffee_drinker = p_coffee_drinker_given_cancer * p_cancer / p_coffee_drinker"],"metadata":{"id":"kFVrFNqkMqIh","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687288012259,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":381,"user":{"displayName":"Vitalii Bakumenko","userId":"13958704867610304595"}}},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(p_cancer_given_coffee_drinker)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"1RYyrdmjM-3d","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687288035681,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":340,"user":{"displayName":"Vitalii Bakumenko","userId":"13958704867610304595"}},"outputId":"ddbb8c3f-9482-4f9e-abde-ca88b31fff4d"},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["0.006538461538461539\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["So the probability someone has cancer given they are a coffee drinker is only 0.65%!
